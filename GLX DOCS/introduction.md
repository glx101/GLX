# GLX

>I am currently working on a new high-level system shell–oriented programming language called GLX.
>The name “GLX” stands for “GNU Language X”.


>The language focuses on dynamic data types, high-level logical control, and predictable behavior.
>While GLX borrows some familiar ideas from traditional shells for practical reasons, it intentionally
>takes a different approach to reduce common pitfalls found in shell scripting, such as confusing
>syntax, implicit behavior, and fragile string handling.

>This project has been brewing for some time and is gradually becoming usable. I am planning an
>initial public release around January 2026. I would greatly appreciate feedback from people who
>work with Bash or other shells—specifically what you like, what frustrates you, and what you feel
>could be improved in system scripting languages.

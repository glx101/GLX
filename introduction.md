# Hello everybody, for those who use bash —

```
I am currently working on a new hight-level system shell programming language called GLX. 
The name “glx” is meant to stand for a Gnu'Language X. This is just a hobby project and is not
intended to be big or professional like existing shells. Glx is interpreter-based and focuses on 
dynamic data types and high-level logical control, aiming to be a simpler and more predictable 
alternative to bash. The project has been brewing for some time and is slowly becoming usable. 
I’m planning to release it in January 2026, and I’d appreciate any feedback on what people like 
or dislike in bash or other shells, since GLX borrows some ideas for practical reasons while 
trying a different approach in others.
